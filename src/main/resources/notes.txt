- Before adding Spring Security dependency, all URLs are accessible
- Once we add it, you'll see that all pages are protected under a login screen
- If you want to access before adding a custom configuration you can use the following infos:
* username : user
* password : it is generated in the output after running your app ( the password is changing every time you start the app )
